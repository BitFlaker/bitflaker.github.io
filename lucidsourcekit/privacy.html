        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <p>The LucidSourceKit project aims to be a privacy-focused app that only operates offline on the local device.</p>
        <br />
        <h1>Data storage</h1>
        <p>All data is stored locally on the device in a location provided by the operating system, which is only accessible by this app. No data is stored outside the local device. This app supports backing up all the stored data in the form of an unencrypted zip compressed file. Exporting data to HTML or backing up data can only be done manually within the app. All data is permanently deleted when the app is uninstalled (except for user-created backups and exports).</p>
        <br />
        <h1>Data sharing</h1>
        <p>This app does not (and cannot on its own) share any data with any other apps, services, or third parties.</p>
        <br />
        <h1>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy may be updated in the future. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. An update will be indicated by a change of the "Last changed on" date listed below.</p>
        <br />
